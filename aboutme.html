  Reflection
</h1>
	
<pa>
I was able to make my website more accesible to the hearing impaired specifically because I chose a video where sound was not
needed to fully enjoy the content.<br>I saw people using moving pictures on their websites which I found really cool. They did this by
copying the link to a gif and inserting it in the same way that you would insert an image.<br>I am most proud of learning how to insert
videos into a website and figuring out how to center it on the page.

<h2>
	Variables
</h2>
	
<pa>
A variable is a character or a string of characters that represents something else. Coders like the keep their code consistent and they
don't really like to use numbers within their code. So, they use a variable to represent a number, and everytime they want to use that
number in their code, they type the variable instead, which is defined earlier in the function.

<h2>
	Loops
	</h2>
	
<pa>
A loop has the ability to repeat an action in code without having to type the code a bunch of times. There are two types of loops: a
while loop and a for loop. A while loop is used when the end result of the code is known but it is uknown how many times the action
must be repeated in order to achieve the end result. A for loop is used when the end result of the action is unknown but it is known how
many times the action will be repeated.

<h2>
	Conditionals
	</h2>
	
<pa>
A conditional specifies an outcome that is dependent upon a certain action. They often contain the words "if" and "else". In a simple
conditional, there are often two outcomes but one condition. If that one condition is met, then one of the outcomes will occur, but
if that condition is not met, then the other outcome will occur. 
	</pa>

<h2>
	Functions
	</h2>
	
<pa>
Functions are used to make codes shorter and cleaner. A function can be created to do a certain action, like multiplying a number by
4. However, the number that is being multiplied by 4 can be changed by the user. Once the function is defined, the function must be
called, or typed into the code, and then a global variable must be defined. That global variable is then put in as the local variable
in the function and the function runs. The user does not need to see the code of the function, they just need to see that it works
when they define their own variables.
